# Text-Prompted Video Object Tracking with Grounding DINO and SAM2

This project explores text-prompted video object tracking using a pipeline built with Grounding DINO and SAM2. The goal is to detect an object from a natural-language prompt, initialize a mask, and then track that object across video frames. I built the project in Python using repository-based scripts, configuration files, lightweight notebooks, and Google Colab for the heavier model stack and inference runs. I also tested different re-grounding strategies to compare how reseeding affected tracking quality on a locked subset of video clips. Along the way, I learned a lot about evaluation design, failure analysis, and the challenge of making computer vision pipelines both accurate and reproducible.

## Highlights

- Uses **Grounding DINO** to localize an object from a text prompt
- Uses **SAM2** to convert detections into masks and propagate them through video
- Separates local development from heavier Colab-based inference workflows
- Supports structured configs, reusable scripts, and reproducible experiment organization
- Includes space for smoke tests, ablations, qualitative outputs, and report assets

## Written Explanation
This project is a computer vision final project focused on referring video object segmentation, where a user gives a natural-language prompt such as `dog`, `car`, or `person` and the system tries to find and track that object through a video. In practice, the pipeline first uses GroundingDINO to ground the text prompt to an object region, then uses SAM2 to convert that region into a segmentation mask and propagate that mask across later frames. The project was built as a modular Python codebase with reusable modules in `src/`, thin command-line scripts in `scripts/`, shared YAML configuration files in `configs/`, and notebooks that call the scripts instead of duplicating logic. The main tools used were Python, OpenCV, NumPy, PyYAML, Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab Pro for heavier GPU runs, Git for version control, and the pretrained GroundingDINO and SAM2 model stacks for detection and segmentation. The development process started with repo wiring and environment validation, then moved into smoke testing, custom-video inference, subset evaluation, failure analysis, and ablation runs to compare tracking behavior under different re-grounding settings. Along the way, several practical issues were addressed, including config-loading and path wiring, checkpoint setup, synthetic overlay validation, stability of the primary `sam2_video_predictor` path, duplicate-manifest reporting caveats, and tuning periodic re-grounding so that a stricter IoU threshold improved hard cases without destabilizing clips that already tracked well.

## Screencapture Video With Audio
No narrated screencapture file is currently stored in this repository, so the README cannot yet embed a real video asset. To satisfy the final submission requirement, replace the placeholder below with your actual YouTube, Google Drive, or GitHub-hosted recording link after you export the screencast.

## Project Overview

This repository is the source of truth for the project code, configs, and lightweight notebooks.

- MacBook Air M4 is the development environment for code, Git, lightweight data work, visualization, local wiring checks, and report assets.
- Google Colab Pro is the compute environment for installing the heavy model stack, downloading checkpoints, running real video inference, and benchmarking.
- Deliverable 0 is repo wiring only: folder structure, docs, config schema, CLI stubs, notebook scaffolds, and a lightweight local validation script.
- Deliverable 1 is the first full model run: GroundingDINO generates boxes from text prompts, SAM2 converts them to masks, and SAM2 video propagation is the default video path.

The repository is organized so that:

- core logic lives in `src/` and `scripts/`
- notebooks call scripts instead of holding business logic
- checkpoints, raw data, and generated outputs stay outside git

- `notebooks/`: thin orchestration notebooks for smoke test, subset eval, and ablations.
- `configs/`: shared YAML config schema for paths, runtime settings, and model-specific parameters.
- `configs/external/`: repo-owned vendor copies of the exact GroundingDINO and SAM2 model configs used by the smoke test.
- `data/`: local-only input staging for raw data, processed data, and very short sample clips.
- `src/`: reusable Python modules for data IO, model wrappers, evaluation, visualization, and utilities.
- `scripts/`: command-line entrypoints used both locally and from Colab notebooks.
- `results/`: qualitative outputs, quantitative summaries, and report figures. These are ignored by git.
- `report/`: outline, references, and exported figures for the write-up.

## Local Workflow
Deliverable 0 should be reproducible without installing GroundingDINO or SAM2.

1. Create and activate a Python environment.
2. Install the pinned base dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the local wiring check:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_env.py --config configs/base.yaml --output-dir outputs/check_env
```

What this validates:

- core package imports
- config loading and schema merging
- synthetic overlay rendering
- JSON artifact writing

Expected output:

- `outputs/check_env/check_overlay.png`
- `outputs/check_env/check_summary.json`

For local experimentation with very short clips, you can also dry-run the CLI shape:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_custom_video.py \
  --config configs/base.yaml \
  --input_video /path/to/short_clip.mp4 \
  --prompt "person with red backpack" \
  --output_dir outputs/smoke_local \
  --max_frames 24
```

This command becomes fully runnable after the D1 Colab model stack is installed and checkpoints are available.

## Colab Workflow
Colab is treated as a compute runner, not the place where project logic lives.

1. Mount Google Drive.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run the base setup:

```bash
bash setup_colab.sh
```

4. For Deliverable 1, install the heavy model stack:

```bash
bash setup_colab.sh --with-models
```

This now also downloads the pinned smoke-test checkpoints into Drive if they are missing.

5. Put checkpoints and inputs in Drive, for example:

```text
/content/drive/MyDrive/cv-final-project/
├── checkpoints/
├── inputs/
└── results/
```

6. Open `notebooks/01_smoke_test.ipynb`, set:

- `PROMPT`
- `INPUT_IMAGE`
- `INPUT_VIDEO`
- `CHECKPOINT_DIR`
- `OUTPUT_DIR`

7. Run the notebook cells. The notebook calls repository scripts and should produce:

- one annotated image with box and mask
- one short overlay video
- one `run_summary.json` with prompt, frame count, runtime, model stack, and artifact paths

## Notes
- The D1 baseline is intentionally limited to `GroundingDINO + SAM2`.
- `Florence-2` is scaffolded in configs and notebooks but is not part of the first runnable smoke test.
- The supported D1 video path is SAM2 video propagation. Frame-by-frame inference exists only as an internal fallback when the official video predictor cannot initialize.
